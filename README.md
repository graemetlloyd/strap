strap is an R package designed to perform stratigraphic analysis of phylogenies, including basic time-scaling, visualisation of time-scaled trees, and applying stratigraphic congruence metrics.

You can install strap in R via CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("strap", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or from github with:

```r
devtools::install_github("graemetlloyd/strap")
```

?strap
```

And clicking on the Index link at the base of the help file will reveal links to every available function.
