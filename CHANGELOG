Version - 1.6.1 - 2024-05-05

- Fixed is.binary.tree obsolete issue with DatePhyloHedman.

Version - 1.6 - 2022-06-10

- Fixes to package to work better with CRAN (changes invisible to user).
- Added proto-versions of DateNodeHedman and DatePhyloHedman functions. These are not yet properly documented or tested.

Version - 1.5 - 2019-08-17

- Restructured package to work with the devtools package (changes invisible to user but makes package easier to update).
- Complete structural overhaul of StratPhyloCongruence function to improve speed.
- Additional options to StratPhyloCongruence to drop SCI calculation (for speed) and to manually provide outgroup taxon (safer than letting function guess this).
- Minor speed up to DatePhylo.

Version - 1.4 - 2014-10-31

- Added three arguments to geoscalePhylo (erotate,arotate and urotate) that allows for the text in the Epoch, Age and User temporal units to be rotated by the user.
- Issue fixed that stopped geoscalePhylo plotting properly when terminal ranges were added to the tree using either DatePhylo or timePaleoPhy (paleotree package).
- Incompatibility with ape fixed that caused an error when plotting a tree with geoscalePhylo that did not include stratigraphic ranges.
- The option for geoscalePhylo called ranges is removed, instead simply including an correctly formatted ages file will cause the stratigraphic ranges to be included in the plot.
- Changed default for fix.topology in StratPhyloCongruence to TRUE.
- Modified calculation for p-values in StratPhyloCongruence to take the arcsine square root of each metric to make data closer to the assumption of a normal distribution.
- Added Wills-type p-value as column to output from StratPhyloCongruence.
- Updated help files for StratPhyloCongruence to note the p-value output changes.

Version - 1.3 - 2014-08-08

- Option added to geoscalePhylo that allows the tree to be plotted vertically using the new argument direction.

Version - 1.2 - 2014-05-12

- Fixed DatePhylo bug with equal and ruta methods regarding order in which branch-sharing occurs (see timePaleoPhy  function in paleotree for additional
